# Computing point-line minimal problems

## Prerequisites

We use [Julia](https://julialang.org/) for the computations.  If you intend to
read the source code, make sure that your editor is able to display UTF-8
characters as it will otherwise not be able to display all characters in the
file.

The required packages for running this software with Julia are:
- [AbstractAlgebra.jl](https://github.com/Nemocas/AbstractAlgebra.jl/),
- [Oscar.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl),
- [HomotopyContinuation.jl](https://github.com/JuliaHomotopyContinuation/HomotopyContinuation.jl)
